CSS Architecture: Positioning, properties & sizing via BEM
- Positioning: Set via parent block (thus block and element themselves can't have margin or positioning)
- Properties: Set in block or element. Overriding/adding properties is set via parent block
- Sizing: Set in block or element. Overriding/adding sizing is set via parent block.

To build these up initially into block & element for a project, use build factoring.
